      <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
      <p>We do not collect personal data.</p>

      <h2>How Locam Works</h2>
      <p>
        Locam is a browser extension that runs entirely on your device. When you
        use Locam to scan a QR code or capture a photo, all processing happens
        locally in your browser.
      </p>
      <p>No data is transmitted to external servers.</p>
      <p>No data is stored beyond the session.</p>
      <p>No identifiers are generated or tracked.</p>

      <h2>Camera Permission</h2>
      <p>
        Locam requires camera access to scan QR codes and capture photos. This
        permission is controlled by your browser, not by us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your browser will ask for permission the first time you use Locam. You
        can revoke this permission at any time through your browser settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Camera access is used exclusively for the functionality you request. The
        camera feed is never recorded, transmitted, or stored.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Processing</h2>
      <p>
        When you scan a QR code, the image is processed locally to extract the
        encoded data. The decoded result is displayed to you and exists only in
        memory during your session.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you capture a photo, the image is saved to your device using your
        browser's download functionality. We never see or store these images.
      </p>

      <p>We do not track how you use the extension.</p>
      <p>We do not collect usage statistics.</p>
      <p>We do not implement telemetry of any kind.</p>
